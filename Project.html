          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Organization can be difficult with many files</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to format a document or insert other file types</li>
            <li>It’s not always obvious who your sharing with or what access they have</li>
            <li> It is difficult and confusing to save links</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p>Our users want to know who is in their files even when its just a link share; so If a person doesn’t have a profile they will have to provide a name or signup.<br> Our users use pinterest partially for how easy it is to save and share links.</p>
          <h3>Solutions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Introduce categories to inspire organization.</li>
            <li>Have a hot key for inserting “#” and a menue.</li>
            <li>Make share options easier to use and more customizable.</li>
            <li>Save links by pasting onto Space page or download a browser extension.</li>

            <h3>Assumptions</h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">There are generally three types of people in the world when it comes to file storage:</p>
            <div><!-- for vertical line  -->
              <ol>
                <li>the people that like to store everything;</li>
                <li>the people that only keep what is essential; and</li>
                <li>the people in between who want to have a lot of files, but they want them organized.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">I, along with most people I know, happen to be the the third type of person. We are the general consumers of the fast growing cloud storage market. Over the years, I have tried a few cloud storage apps and they all do different things really well. So when prompted to create a cloud storage app I decided to put all of those great features together and see if anyone else shares my problems and if not  solve the problems they where having. </p>

              <p>Frustrations</p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">It is hard to insert code into documents for review or discusion. My team often works together on dicuments but we all use the comany account because its difficult share and set permissions, so we never know who chnaged what.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis Hilights</h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">In order to see where Space will sit in the market, I needed to dig deeper into the world of cloud storage and oragnization apps. In my user survey, I asked which apps people use most for cloud storage and organization. Google drive, DropBox, Box, and even Pinterest was among them. </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">Some of their strengths were sharing and collaborating - some focus more on who was collaborating and some focus more on what they have changed. DropBox handles sharing permissions best. Google Drive marks where people are really well. Overall they provide a lot of information in its simplest form. None of these apps have an easy way of saving links.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>User flows &amp; User stories</h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">Based on the information gathered from the surveys, and competitive analysis I created user stories to highlight the main features of the product. The user stories were then converted into User flows done in Sketch, to illustrate how the user would interact with the product and accomplish those goals.</p>

            <p class="caseStudy-text">Now I was ready to generate concepts and thumbnails based on my research. I kept myself accountable to my users as I started designing for Space with my research.</p>
            <div>
              <p>My users are mostly females (60% female, 40%male), 29 and younger that are students or work in industries of business, education, technology, marketing, or design.<br>They use cloud storage for a mix of professional and personal use every day primarily on their desktop/laptop computer. But occasionally on their phone too.<br>They want to send/share large files and folder, collaborate and create content.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">Space was chosen as the name for this application because of its flexibility in how it can be interpreted. To some, it will mean the space on the page or different work spaces, or you can take it literally as the space the application is providing for you. Either way it's your space, and you can do what you want with it.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">The cloud storage and organization industry is a fast-growing and complicated, Just like its user's needs. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">There is already a lot of excellent cloud storage companies out there, so initially, I was doubtful, especially when 80% of people said that they use Google Drive because it's convenient. But to my surprise, in my last round of user testing, people loved Space. The categories were a huge hit! People liked the organization and the minimalist new doc page. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Of course, my app isn’t perfect though! It may have a convenient to-do list feature and be some organizational help, but it doesn’t have quick note taking like most cloud storage apps, and it could use some keyboard shortcuts for all of us tech nerds, I mean tech-savvy people. </p>
