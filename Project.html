          <ol class="num-list">
            <li>1. Organization can be difficult with many files</li>
            <li>2. It can be difficult to format a document or insert other file types</li>
            <li>3. It’s not always obvious who your sharing with or what access they have</li>
            <li>4. It is difficult and confusing to save links</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <p class="num-list par-space">Our users want to know who is in their files even when its just a link share; so If a person doesn’t have a profile they will have to provide a name or signup.</p>
          <p class="num-list par-space"> Our users use pinterest partially for how easy it is to save and share links.</p>
          <h3>Solutions</h3>
          <ol class="num-list">
            <li>1. Introduce categories to inspire organization.</li>
            <li>2. Have a hot key for inserting “#” and a menue.</li>
            <li>3. Make share options easier to use and more customizable.</li>
            <li>4. Save links by pasting onto Space page or download a browser extension.</li>

                <li>3. The people in between who want to have a lot of files, but they want them organized.</li>
              </ol>
            <p class="caseStudy-text padding-top">I, along with most people I know, happen to be the the third type of person. We are the general consumers of the fast growing cloud storage market. Over the years, I have tried a few cloud storage apps and they all do different things really well. So when prompted to create a cloud storage app I decided to put all of those great features together and see if anyone else shares my problems and if not  solve the problems they where having. </p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis Hilights</h3>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">In order to see where Space will sit in the market, I needed to dig deeper into the world of cloud storage and oragnization apps. In my user survey, I asked which apps people use most for cloud storage and organization. Google drive, DropBox, Box, and even Pinterest was among them. </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">Some of their strengths were sharing and collaborating - some focus more on who was collaborating and some focus more on what they have changed. DropBox handles sharing permissions best. Google Drive marks where people are really well. Overall they provide a lot of information in its simplest form. None of these apps have an easy way of saving links.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">The cloud storage and organization industry is a fast-growing and complicated, Just like its user's needs. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">There is already a lot of excellent cloud storage companies out there, so initially, I was doubtful, especially when 80% of people said that they use Google Drive because it's convenient. But to my surprise, in my last round of user testing, people loved Space. The categories were a huge hit! People liked the organization and the minimalist new doc page. </p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Of course, my app isn’t perfect though! It may have a convenient to-do list feature and be some organizational help, but it doesn’t have quick note taking like most cloud storage apps, and it could use some keyboard shortcuts for all of us tech nerds, I mean tech-savvy people. </p>
          <p class=" caseStudy-text subhead">Leason Learned</p>
          <p class="caseStudy-text">Oh, and I had to take out my beloved “create” button because everyone wanted to have a single “add” button. I held onto that create button all the way to the end when a final A&B test smacked me in the face and said, “NO ONE GETS THE “CREATE” BUTTON!” So I let it go. But now I know that the more testing you can do the better, and it’s okay to love an idea, but you have to be willing to let it go too. </p>
